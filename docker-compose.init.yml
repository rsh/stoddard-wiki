# MediaWiki - Initial Setup Configuration (Development)
#
# Use this file for first-time setup when LocalSettings.php doesn't exist yet
#
# Usage: docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.init.yml up -d
#
# After completing the MediaWiki installation wizard and downloading LocalSettings.php:
#   1. Place LocalSettings.php in instance/LocalSettings.php
#   2. Stop: docker-compose down
#   3. Start normally: docker-compose up -d (this will use the regular config with LocalSettings.php mounted)
#
# Note: This file intentionally does NOT mount LocalSettings.php since it doesn't exist yet.
